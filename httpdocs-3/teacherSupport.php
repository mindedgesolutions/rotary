                  <p>Teacher training is the main focus of the entire Teacher Support vertical. The role of teachers in shaping the minds of the youth is undeniable. Teachers from government schools undergo pre service as well as in service training during their career. However, apart from this, regular workshops, seminars and training should be encouraged to enhance the capabilities of a teacher. There are various institutions that specialize in training teachers. Rotary India Literacy Mission’s Teacher Training program focuses on providing such facility to the government schools and government aided schools across India by collaborating with institutions that specialize in this. </p>

                   instills them with renewed confidence and encourages them to perform better. It also gives an idea about the less effective teachers in the surveyed schools, who
                   are later helped with training sessions and workshops to enhance their performance.

                  <p>Often in Government/Government-Aided schools there is a severe dearth of teachers,as a result of which one teacher has to teach a number of subjects in which
                   s/he is not specialized. This not only becomes hectic for the teacher but also the quality of education is compromised. The best possible solution to this is 
                   providing supplemental education in schools through volunteers.
